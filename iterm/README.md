# Hyper

[Hyper](https://hyper.is) is an open source replacement for Apple's Terminal. It's highly customisable and comes with a lot of useful features.

## Installation

Use [Homebrew](../homebrew/) to download and install:

```bash
brew install --cask hyper
```

## Customisation

### Name

I like to change the name of Hyper.app to Terminal.app which makes it easier to open via muscle memory from spotlight. You probably need to open the Hyper app 3-4 times before Spotlight remembers not to suggest the default terminal app.
